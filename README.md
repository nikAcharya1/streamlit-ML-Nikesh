Using Streamlit cloud hosting platform, a public website is created that allows and instructs a
user to upload a facial image and the app uses 5 pre-trained models to display binary image
classification results (0 – no eyeglasses present, 1 – eyeglasses present). The Streamlit app is linked to a
Github repository. The repository contains the saved models and a python program to execute the
Streamlit web application.
