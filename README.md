Using Streamlit cloud hosting platform, a public website is created that allows and instructs a
user to upload a facial image and the app uses two pre-trained AI models to display binary image
classification results (0 – no eyeglasses present, 1 – eyeglasses present). 

Model A : custom CNN model from scratch,
Model B : custom CNN model on top of the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model
